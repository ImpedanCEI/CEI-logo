# CEI logo
> Updating the ABP-CEI logo using Wakis

## Getting started
You can install wakis from GitHub to have the latest changes into your conda environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/wakis.git
pip install -e wakis
```
or 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/wakis.git@main
```

That's it! Now you can run the notebook `CEI_logo_playground.ipynb` and start generating your own version of the CEI logo :heart:

* :folder: stl/ contains the geometry of the cavity and the letters for the logo
* :folder: img/ contains some example images you can generate. Your simulation results will be generated there
